# What To Watch

'What To Watch' is a Python 3.x-based tool that scrapes through your Letterboxd profile and provides you with a summary of all movies seen by your followers/following list. Run the tool after adjusting the `USERNAME`, `PROFILE_URL`, `LIST_TYPE`, `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME` variables in `main.py` with the following shell commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveen-vivek/what-to-watch.git;
cd what-to-watch;
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt;
python main.py;
```

After this, you can scroll through the output to see what movies your friends enjoy!
